    Parameters
    ----------
    model : BasePhysicalModel
        The model to draw from. This may have its own parameters which
        will be randomly sampled with each draw.
    num_samples : int
        The number of samples.
    obstable : ObsTable or List of ObsTable
        The ObsTable(s) from which to extract information for the samples.
    passbands : PassbandGroup or List of PassbandGroup
        The passbands to use for generating the bandfluxes.
    apply_obs_mask: boolean

        to save context information about how the light curves were generated. If the column
        is missing from one of the ObsTables, a null value such as None or NaN is used.

    param_cols : list of str, optional
        A list of the model's parameter columns to be saved as separate columns in
        the results (instead of just the full dictionary of parameters). These
        must be specified as strings in the node_name.param_name format.
        If None, no additional columns are saved.
    rng : numpy.random._generator.Generator, optional
        A given numpy random number generator to use for this computation. If not
