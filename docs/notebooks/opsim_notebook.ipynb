    "A critical aspect to producing realistic simulations of time varying phenomena is correctly modeling the cadence at which the objects will be observed and capturing the relevant physical details about the observation. TDAstro provides an `OpSim` module that can load a Rubin opsim file and use that to filter observations based on location, associate observations with their filter, apply detector noise, etc.\n",

    "## OpSim Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OpSim` object provides a wrapper for loading and querying survey-specific information including pointings and survey information. The required information is:\n",
    "  * the pointing data (RA, dec, and times for each pointing), and\n",
    "  * the zero point information for each pointing (a zero point column or the information needed to derive it)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common information includes the airmass, exposure time, and filter used (the information needed to derive the zero points).\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the `OpSim` objects use a table with the column names are given by the imported data. For Rubin opsim files, this means columns will have names such as \"observationStartMJD\" or \"fieldRA\". Since different inputs may have different columns, the class provides the ability to map simple column names such as \"ra\" and \"time\" to the corresponding table names. The constructor allows the user to pass a column-mapping dictionary that maps the short column name to the name used within the database. The default column-mapper corresponds to the Rubin opsim format:\n",
    "  * \"airmass\" -> \"airmass\"\n",
    "  * \"dec\" -> \"fieldDec\"\n",
    "  * \"exptime\" -> \"visitExposureTime\"\n",
    "  * \"filter\" -> \"filter\"\n",
    "  * \"ra\" -> \"fieldRA\"\n",
    "  * \"time\" -> \"observationStartMJD\"\n",
    "By default `OpSim` will look for Rubin column names, such as \"observationStartMJD\" and \"fieldRA\".\n",

    "We can create a simple `OpSim` by manually specifying the data as a dict or a pandas dataframe."
