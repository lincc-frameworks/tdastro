Find (or make) a new GitHub issue
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add yourself as the assignee on an existing issue so that we know who's working 
on what. If you're not actively working on an issue, unassign yourself.

If there isn't an issue for the work you want to do, please create one and include
a description.

You can reach the team with bug reports, feature requests, and general inquiries
by creating a new GitHub issue.

Create a branch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is preferable that you create a new branch with a name like 
``issue/##/<short-description>``. GitHub makes it pretty easy to associate 
branches and tickets, but it's nice when it's in the name.

Set up a development environment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing any dependencies or writing code, it's a great idea to create a
virtual environment such as `venv`:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> python3 -m venv ~/envs/tdastro
   >> source ~/envs/tdastro/bin/activate


Once you have created a new environment, you can install this project for local
development using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> pip install -e .'[dev]'
   >> pre-commit install


Notes:

1) The single quotes around ``'[dev]'`` may not be required for your operating system.
2) ``pre-commit install`` will initialize pre-commit for this local repository, so
   that a set of tests will be run prior to completing a local commit. For more
   information, see the Python Project Template documentation on
   `pre-commit <https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/practices/precommit.html>`_.
3) Install ``pandoc`` allows you to verify that automatic rendering of Jupyter notebooks
   into documentation for ReadTheDocs works as expected. For more information, see
   the Python Project Template documentation on
   `Sphinx and Python Notebooks <https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/practices/sphinx.html#python-notebooks>`_.

.. tip::
    Installing on Mac
       
    When installing dev dependencies, make sure to include the single quotes.

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        $ pip install -e '.[dev]'

Testing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please add or update unit tests for all changes made to the codebase. You can run
unit tests locally simply with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest

If you're making changes to the sphinx documentation (anything under ``docs``),
you can build the documentation locally with a command like:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd docs
    make html
